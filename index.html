        <p class="about-info">I was born in Cuba and raised in Miami. I pursued an undergraduate degree in 
          Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University. With 1-2 semester left,
          I made the decision to leave Cornell and start a career in software engineering.</p> 
          <ul class="about-info"> 
            <h1>A few things I did in my time there:</h1> 
            <li>Gain leadership experience in different E-board roles for Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers</li> 
            <li>Conduct research where I designed and built a mobile phone signal jammer with variable capacitance to optimize attenuation through MATLAB implemented mathematical model</li>
          </ul> 
        <p class="about-info">My time at Cornell 
          gave me a solid background in engineering fundamentals as well as programming experience. I plan to take this with me
          on my journey.</p>
